================

Growing Shade is a unique tool that highlights stories and allows users
to create custom reports to inform tree canopy enhancement and
preservation for the Twin Cities region.

There are additional tools and resources that may be useful for this
work. Please consider the list below as a starting point. Additionally,
when planning and prioritizing urban forestry work, tools and data
cannot substitute for stakeholder engagement to understand
community-specific concerns or opportunities. The on-the-ground
knowledge of residents and the expertise of local practitioners are
valuable sources of information.
