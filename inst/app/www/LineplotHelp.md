The line in the middle of the box shows the median value: half of the
geographies fall below the median, and half of them lie above the
median. The median is also known as the 50th percentile. The top and
bottom edges of the box show the 75th percentile (the value below which
75% of the geographic areas fall) and the 25th percentile (the value
below which 25% of the geographic areas fall). Geographies located above
and below the vertical lines extending from the box are particularly
extreme values.
