## Overview

Growing Shade is a new tool for improving the equity and sustainability
of the Twin Cities region through tree canopy enhancement and
preservation. Equity and sustainability are two outcomes of the Thrive
2040 regional policy plan which Growing Shade makes actionable. Growing
Shade can be accessed at: www.growingshade.com or
<https://metrotransitmn.shinyapps.io/growing-shade/>.

Growing Shade is predicated on the fact that trees help the region
thrive. Benefits from trees include cooler temperatures, improved air
quality, cleaner stormwater, improved mental health, and enhanced
biodiversity. Enhancing and preserving tree canopy cover is an
actionable step to create healthy and resilient places.

Trees additionally connect to regional issues and priorities. Public
health, environmental justice, climate change, and natural resource
conservation all intersect with the tree canopy. Growing Shade provides
tree planting efforts and ongoing maintenance with new perspectives,
rigorous science, and thoughtful synthesis.

Growing Shade combines local **stories** and an **interactive mapping
tool** to inform tree canopy enhancement and preservation.

**This repository walks through the creation and aggregation of data
used in interactive mapping tool.**

## Scaling to other regions

I have tried to make an RShiny application that is highly portable, well
documented, and requires minimal coding in order to lower the bar for
other regions who might like to implement this type of “growing shade”
analysis. Everything is open source!

Please navigate to the `Tutorial.Rmd` script to begin processing data
for other regions.

## Evolution of the project

Growing shade concept is a merger of:

-   Fundamental ecological principles coupled with remote sensing (for
    technical tree parameters, data, and metrics)
-   Conversations with advisory group for Growing Shade Project (for
    concept and framing)
-   The Economic Values Atlas project in collaboration with Brookings
    Institution (for methods of synthesizing demographic data)
