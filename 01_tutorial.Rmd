# Introduction

Growing Shade is a prioritization tool for tree canopy enhancement and preservation. Growing Shade was conceptualized by the Metropolitan Council, Tree Trust, and The Nature Conservancy with a focus on the Twin Cities (Minnesota) area. All analyses and code were developed by Ellen Esch. The Twin Cities version of Growing Shade can  be accessed at: www.growingshade.com or https://metrotransitmn.shinyapps.io/growing-shade/. 

The components of Growing Shade relevant to population demographics (i.e., determining environmental justice priority areas) can be scaled to any area within the United States. The components relevant to the tree canopy have been parameterized to the Twin Cities region, but should work pretty well in other temperate areas with deciduous and coniferous trees.

This tutorial walks through how to grab and synthesize various data pieces which go into making Growing Shade. This document should be useful when doing data updates update, or trying to scale this workflow to other regions/areas.

The first time you run this code, it will be helpful to walk step-by-step through the various pieces. There are several places where you'll get instructions to request and save API keys, or other manual steps which can't be automated. However, after you walk thorough it initially, in future runs (if needed) or for small data/geography adjustments, you can probably be successful running everything in one go!

# Set parameters

These global parameters dictate what state/county combinations will be used, as well as from what year various data pieces come from. Since the data pieces are updated on different schedules, it's unfortunately not as simple as setting a "global" rule to use data corresponding to the current year

This code is set up to use/process 2020-era census geographies at the block group level (even though some data sources are still using 2010-era geographies...but we'll deal with those later).

# Process demographic data

The demographic information is fetched using the APIs/app tokens. Follow these instructions:

You will need an API key from Census:

-   [Request an api key](https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html)
-   Enter in the console: `usethis::edit_r_environ()`
-   When the `.Renviron` file comes up in the editor, type: `CENSUS_KEY="KEY GOES HERE, INSIDE QUOTES"`
-   Save and close the `.Renviron` file.
-   Restart R.

You will need an app token from CDC:

-   [Request an app token](https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/profile/edit/developer_settings)
-   You may have to create an account with Tyler Data & Insights ID
    -   More information about "app tokens" and metadata are on the [PLACES data overview](https://dev.socrata.com/foundry/chronicdata.cdc.gov/cwsq-ngmh)
    -   Note that CDC has APIs and app tokens. It's a bit confusing, but be sure you are looking at the app token for this.
-   Enter in the console: `usethis::edit_r_environ()`
-   When the `.Renviron` file comes up in the editor, type: - `CDC_KEY="APP TOKEN GOES HERE, INSIDE QUOTES"` - `CDC_EMAIL="email you signed up with goes here, inside quotes"`
-   `CDC_PASSWORD="password you used to signup with goes here, inside quotes"`
-   Save and close the `.Renviron` file.
-   Restart R.

## Decennial census

Race variables come from the decennial 2020 census. Currently, the decennial census data is preferred over ACS data because it is a population count rather than a sample and because ACS data uses the average of 5 years (so starting with the ACS 2021-2025 data, it may be logical to switch over to using the ACS data instead).

```{r decennial}
if (process_demographics == TRUE) {
  if (detailed_population_count == TRUE) {
    # this more detailed population count data is not currently being incorporated, because better data doesn't exist at this point! The skeleton should be useful when better data does exist...

## American Community Survey

Other demographic variables come from the American Community Survey 5-year data. ACS numbers come from a surveyed population sample.

Check what is the most [recent year of ACS data here](https://api.census.gov/data.html). Search for "acs5" and see what is the most recent year of data available.

Of course, more variables from ACS can be added. The easiest way is to add variables which exist at the block group level. If you're adding variables where tract-level data is the most detailed geography reported, follow the steps in the code below which processes the disability information. If more variables are being added from ACS, please be sure to update the metadata.csv file (this is outlined later in the "combine all variables" step).

```{r acs}

## PLACES health data

Health metrics come from [PLACES: Local Data for Better Health, Census Tract Data](https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/500-Cities-Places/PLACES-Local-Data-for-Better-Health-Census-Tract-D/cwsq-ngmh). I am not aware that there is a way to use a "health_year" parameter to get a specific timestamp of the data, so please just double check that the most recent data is being used! CDC has indicated that they *might* soon be switching over to using 2020-vintage census geographies rather than the old 2010 geographies, so the processing will get simplified at that point.

Also, because this CDC data currently uses old census geographies, you will need to download a crosswalk - Download the state-specific crosswalk of ["Block Groups --\> Census Tracts" for year "2010 --\> 2020" from NHGIS](https://www.nhgis.org/geographic-crosswalks#download-from-block-groups) - Place the resultant file in the data-raw folder

```{r health}

# Process geographies

Growing Shade is set up to have data at the block group, neighborhood, and city/township (ctu) levels.

### Census block groups

Getting these geography files is easy - just downloaded directly.

```{r census-geography, include = F}
<<<<<<< refs/remotes/origin/metcouncil-2021
bg_geo <- block_groups(
  state = state,
  county = county,
  year = census_year
)
=======
bg_geo <- block_groups(state = state, 
                                    county = county,
                                    year = census_year) 
>>>>>>> knit rmd

# sf::st_write(bg_geo, "/Users/escheh/Documents/GitHub/planting.shade/storymap-info/shapefiles/bg_geo.shp", append = FALSE)
```


### Neighborhoods and city levels

Since we're going to be making a map which shows census tracts, cities, or neighborhoods depending on the user input, a crosswalk needs to be made which relates block groups to the city and neighborhood levels.

This section doesn't seem to be easily scalable to other regions **unless zip codes are an appropriate stand-in for neighborhoods**. As such, the code for this section will likely need to be customized, and processing will be done within the `02_geographies.Rmd` script. Further, if this section doesn't apply for other regions, it should be easy enough to remove elements in the user-interface of the application.

In any case, the following files should exist in the `data` folder (again, the `02_geographies.Rmd` script shows an example of creating these files for the Twin Cities region).

- **ctu_crosswalk** which assign every block group in the region into a core city. Column names should be as follows:
  - `GEO_NAME` (city name, e.g. "Minneapolis" or "Stillwater")
  - `bg_id` (block group id)
- **nhood_crosswalk** which assigns block group in the region into a neighborhood. Column names should be as follows:
  - `GEO_NAME` (neighborhood name, e.g. "Powderhorn" or "Downtown")

# Remote sensing data

This section *may* scale to other regions, but currently requires some initial processing steps done *outside* of R, and hence the code has been moved into the `03_remotesensing.Rmd` script.

- **bg_canopy** which has the tree canopy cover of every block group. Columns should be as follows:
  - `bg_id` (block group identifier)
  - `canopy_percent` (the percent tree canopy cover in the block group)
  - `avgcanopy` (the average block group tree canopy cover; note, for the best comparative value, this avgcanopy variable should *not* be the regional average tree canopy (which would require incorporating the fact that all block groups are not the same area))
- **ctu_list_raw** which has information about the tree canopy at the city level. Columns:
  - `GEO_NAME` (the name of the city/township)
  - `canopy_percent` (the percent tree canopy cover in the city)
  - `avgcanopy` (the average canopy cover of block groups within the city)
  - `min` (the canopy cover value from the block group with the lowest tree cover in the city)
  - `max` (the canopy cover value from the block group with the highest tree cover in the city)
  - `n_blockgroups` (the number of block groups which fall inside the city)
  - `geometry` (the spatial coordinates of the city polygon)
- **nhood_list_raw** which has information about the tree canopy at the neighborhood level. Columns:
  - `GEO_NAME` (the name of the neighborhood)
  - `city` (the city in which the neighborhood is located)
  - `canopy_percent` (the percent tree canopy cover in the neighborhood)
  - `avgcanopy` (the average canopy cover of block groups within the neighborhood)

  - `max` (the canopy cover value from the block group with the highest tree cover in the neighborhood)
  - `n_blockgroups` (the number of block groups which fall inside the neighborhood)
  - `geometry` (the spatial coordinates of the neighborhood polygon)
- **bg_ndvi** which has information about the greenness (as measured via NDVI, or normalized difference vegetation index) of block groups
  - `bg_id` (block group identifier)
  - `ndvi_uncultivated` (average NDVI over uncultivated land)
  - `ndvi_land` (average NDVI over all land, including cropland)

# Environmental data


## Lifetime cancer risk from air toxins

The EPA's 2021 EJSCREEN data release can be downloaded automatically and filtered for the region of interest. Interestingly, the 2021 EJSCREEN data uses 2017 AirToxScreen data, even though there does appear to be a more recent, [2018 AirToxScreen file](https://www.epa.gov/AirToxScreen/2018-airtoxscreen-assessment-results) as of October 3, 2022. 

It is my recommendation to use the EJSCREEN data because the process can be automated, and then just [check back to see when this data gets updated for future years](https://gaftp.epa.gov/EJSCREEN). Hopefully the 2018 AirToxScreen data will be incorporated soon. 

Additionally, please note that the 2021 EJSCREEN data is using old (2010-vintage) Census geographies (at the tract level). Fortunately, the crosswalk downloaded to process the PLACES health data will additionally work here. 


```{r air-toxins}
if (process_demographics == TRUE) {
  temp <- tempfile()
  temp2 <- tempfile()
  download.file(
    "https://gaftp.epa.gov/EJSCREEN/2021/EJSCREEN_2021_USPR_Tracts.csv.zip",
    destfile = temp
  )
  unzip(zipfile = temp, exdir = temp2)
  list.files(temp2)

  ejscreen <- read_csv(paste0(temp2, pattern = "/EJSCREEN_2021_USPR_Tracts.csv"),
    col_select = c(ST_ABBREV, CANCER, ID)
  ) %>%

  #   st_as_sf() %>%
  #   ggplot() +
  #   geom_sf(aes(fill = CANCER))

  files <- list.files(temp2, full.names = T)
  file.remove(files)

## Climate vulnerability - temperature & flooding

This section relies on processing remote sensing data outside of R, and may require some specific processing to work for other regions. Here, the files created are as follow: 

- **env_data** Column names, as applicable, should be as follows:
  - `bg_id` (block group geo-identifier)
  - `avg_temp` (average land surface temperature during a heatwave)
  - `prim_flood` (amount of land susceptible to primary flooding)

## MPCA area of environmental justice concern

This data was used initially, but it seems as if MPCA has stopped updating the data, thus it no longer seems relevant.  

```{r mpca}
# nothing here yet; this seems to be out-of-date...but it could come from equity considerations data
```

# Create final data pieces

These steps outline how to finally create the final files which are needed to run the application. All of these files will go into the `data` folder.

## Merge data variables

Merge demographic and environmental data. Additionally, standardize and re-scale variables so we can create equally weighted priority scores. Do *not* include spatial data at this point, it should be joined after summarizing to save computational time.

Additionally, please check (and double check if problems arise) the `data-raw/metadata.csv` file. If you wish to exclude variables (which have been processed in steps above), simply remove the variable row from the metadata file. If you have added variables in the steps above, please make sure that those new variables appear in the metadata (or else the variables still will not appear in the final data).

## Create regional averages

For comparative purposes, regional averages need to be computed. While the average values for the block groups are needed to create z-scores in the scaling and standardizing steps, those averages are *not* the regional averages. For instance, the average median income of block groups might be 60,000 but the regional average might be lower if there are more people living in ares with lower income. 

The regional average data mostly comes from data which has already been fetched from the census (either decennial or ACS). In other cases, you may wish to supplement with regional averages for other data pieces.

## Simplify data for speed

Because all of the files inside the `data` folder need to be pushed up to the cloud in order to deploy the full version of Growing Shade, it is important to make the files as small as possible. This is very important to help loading speed of the application. In essence, most geographic files (polygons) can be simplified to some degree. All data files should only have the necessary columns for running the application, and extraneous columns should be removed. 

```{r}
speed_up <- function(x, smooth) {
  x %>%
    sf::st_transform(26915) %>%
    sf::st_simplify(dTolerance = smooth, preserveTopology = T) %>%
    sf::st_transform(4326)

count(st_drop_geometry(ua), UATYP10) #Census urban area type; U = Urbanized Area; C = Urban Cluster 

# Counties can be categorized into levels of rurality based on the percentage of the decennial census population living in the rural areas. Using 2010 Census data, counties were classified as "mostly urban" (less than 50 percent of the population lived in rural areas), "mostly rural" (50 to 99.9 percent of the population lived in rural areas), and "completely rural" (100 percent of the population lived in rural areas)

If the follow steps have been followed, you should be able to navigate to the `./dev/run_dev.R` file, select all the code, and run! This should initiate a local version of Growing Shade for the customized region! 


## Set user interface parameters

<<<<<<< refs/remotes/origin/metcouncil-2021
<<<<<<< refs/remotes/origin/metcouncil-2021
Creating a `ui_params.rda` data set is the easiest solutions that I can (currently!) think of which allows for site-specific parameters to be set *outside* of the main application code. For instance, other regions are unlikely to have a city called "Oakdale," but regardless a starting city needs to be identified in order for the map to render correctly. 

```{r}
map_centroid <- region_outline %>%
  st_union() %>%
  st_centroid()

ui_params <- tribble(
  ~param, ~set, ~number,
  "cityselected", if (nrow(ctu_list) >= 129) {
    ctu_list[[129, 1]]
  } else {
    ctu_list %>%
      arrange(-n_blockgroups) %>%
      .[[1, 1]]
  }, NA_real_, # "Oakdale", NA_real_,
  "nhoodselected", "Frogtown", NA_real_,
  "center_latitude", NA_character_, st_coordinates(map_centroid)[2], # 44.963,

## Troubleshooting application


## Edit and add any region-specific language

There will likely be region-specific information that should be displayed alongside the data within the interactive application. Users should edit files within the "R" folder as prudent. 
>>>>>>> generalize parameters

## Using ArcGIS for processing

If platforms other than R are used for processing data, there shouldn't be any problem! However, you may need to replace sections of the R processing code with code that reads in .shp files and saves them as .rda files. You'll also need to just ensure that the spatial projection is correct for the leaflet package, which is used to map everything. I would recommend placing the raw shapefiles inside the data-raw folder. Here is an example of some code:

```{r ex-shapefile, include = F, eval = F}

test <- sf::read_sf(paste0(here::here(), "/data-raw/your_shapefile_name_here.shp")) %>%
  sf::st_transform(4326)
