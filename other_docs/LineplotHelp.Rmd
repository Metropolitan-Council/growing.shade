The line in the middle of the box shows the median value: half of the geographies fall below the median, and half of them lie above the median. The median is also known as the 50th percentile. The top and bottom edges of the box show the 75th percentile (the value below which 75% of the geographic areas fall) and the 25th percentile (the value below which 25% of the geographic areas fall). Geographies located above and below the vertical lines extending from the box are particularly extreme values.
